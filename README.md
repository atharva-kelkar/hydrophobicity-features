# Structural Features of Interfacial Water

This repository contains analysis tools to analyse the properties of SAM-water systems, specifically 

* Calculation of water structural features (triplet angles, distribution of triplet angles, hydrogen bonding between water molecules, SAM-water hydrogen bonds, and SAM-SAM hydrogen bonds)
* Data analysis tools (LASSO, random forest, multivariate linear regression)
